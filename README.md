# Science-Calculator
little project called science calculator done with vanila JS and DOM manipulation. Also practising user's inputs and processing them to display the answer,
while trying to minimize the ways where the user is blocked and need to reset to start over. For example, the user can continue making complex calculations without having the need to press equal sign 
or if the user came to a Math error, he can keep doing calculations without being blocked.
